### Problem Statement for Classification Task

#### Introduction
The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has posed significant challenges to societies and economies worldwide. One of the notable impacts has been on environmental conditions, particularly air quality. India, known for its poor air quality, has experienced varying pollution levels before and after the pandemic. This study aims to analyze the changes in air quality and classify air quality conditions using a multiclass classification approach.

#### Problem Statement
This project aims to investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on air pollution levels in India and classify the air quality conditions using a machine learning classification model. Specifically, the goal is to understand how air quality indicators such as PM2.5, PM10, NO, NO2, NOx, NH3, CO, SO2, O3, Benzene, Toluene, and Xylene have changed during and after the pandemic lockdowns, and to accurately classify air quality into different categories based on these indicators.

#### Objectives
1. **Analyze Air Quality Trends**: Evaluate the trends in air quality indicators before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown periods.
2. **Classify Air Quality Conditions**: Develop a machine learning model to classify air quality into predefined categories (e.g., Good, Moderate, Poor, Very Poor, Severe).
3. **Compare Pre- and Post-Pandemic Air Quality**: Assess the differences in air quality conditions before and after the pandemic.

#### Solution Overview
The proposed solution involves several key steps:

1. **Data Wrangling**: Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, date formatting, and ensure all necessary features are correctly represented.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform comprehensive EDA to understand the distribution and relationships of air quality indicators.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance. This may include aggregating data, creating time-based features, or normalizing data.
4. **Modeling**: Build and evaluate multiple classification models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks) to classify air quality conditions. Use appropriate metrics to assess model performance.
5. **Comparison Analysis**: Compare the air quality indicators before and after the pandemic using statistical and visual analysis tools to draw meaningful insights.

#### Expected Outcome
The expected outcome of this project is a robust classification model capable of accurately predicting air quality conditions based on the given indicators. Additionally, the analysis will provide insights into how air quality in India has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially guiding future environmental policies and measures.

By leveraging machine learning for classification, this project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of air pollution dynamics and support efforts to improve air quality in India.
